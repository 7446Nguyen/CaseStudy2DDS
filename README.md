DDSAnalytics has chosen multiple machine learning techniques to identify prospective candidate attrition and salary trends. Doing so will allow us to better select the right job seeker for our clients. Logistic and Naive Bayes classiﬁcation models will be compared and one will be selected to predict candidate attrition. A successful classiﬁer will have at least a 60% sensitivity and 60% speciﬁcity.
