# Welcome to DDSAnalytics Case Study 2: "Understanding Attrition and Salary Trends" repository!

## Introduction

DDSAnalytics has chosen multiple machine learning techniques to identify prospective candidate attrition and salary trends.  Doing so will allow us to better select the right job seeker for our clients.  Logistic and Naive Bayes classification models will be compared and one will be selected to predict candidate attrition.  A successful classifier will have at least a 60% sensitivity and 60% specificity.  A salary model using linear regression will also be used to identify salary trends given the features provided where the RMSE must below $3000.  RStudio 1.2.1335 and R 3.6.1 will be used to manipulate, model, and present the data to the client.
