# Logistic and Naive Bayes Classification

## Overview

This project, part of **SMU's MSDS program for Doing Data Science**, focuses on predicting employee attrition and analyzing salary trends using machine learning techniques. By implementing and comparing **Logistic Regression** and **Naive Bayes classifiers**, the goal is to identify the most effective model for predicting candidate attrition. Additionally, **linear regression** is employed to model salary trends, aiding in the selection of suitable job seekers for clients.

## Repository Structure

- **Wrangling and Modeling/** â€“ Contains scripts and notebooks for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development.
- **data/** â€“ Includes datasets used for training and evaluation.
- **predictionData/** â€“ Holds data intended for making predictions with the developed models.
- **caseStudy2.pdf** â€“ Comprehensive report detailing the methodologies, analyses, and findings of the study.
- **caseStudy2Nguyen_Presentation.pptx** â€“ Presentation summarizing the project's objectives, processes, and key results.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- **Model Implementation**:
  - **Logistic Regression**: A discriminative model predicting the probability of a candidate's attrition.
  - **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A generative model applying Bayes' theorem under the assumption of feature independence.
  - **Linear Regression**: Analyzing and predicting salary trends.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy to determine the best-performing classifier.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/7446Nguyen/Logistic-and-Naive-Bayes-Classification.git
   cd Logistic-and-Naive-Bayes-Classification
   ```
2. **Set Up Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install necessary packages using `pip` or `conda` as specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. **Run Scripts**:
   - Navigate to the `Wrangling and Modeling/` directory.
   - Execute the relevant Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to preprocess data, train models, and make predictions.

## Data Source

The datasets used in this project are located in the `data/` directory. These datasets contain employee attributes and are used for training and evaluating the classification and regression models.
